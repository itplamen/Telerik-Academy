﻿//08.Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.
//Example: The word is "in". The text is:

//We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. 
//So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.

//The expected result is:

//We are living in a yellow submarine.
//We will move out of it in 5 days.

//Consider that the sentences are separated by "." and the words – by non-letter symbols.
